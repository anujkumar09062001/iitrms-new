              With an aim to improve the overall design and focusing on the
              electric powertrain, the team developed its third electric racecar
              RMSE19. It is ergonomically designed safe and durable for track
              racing. With a 100kW motor, RMSE19 can accelerate from 0-100kmph
              in just 3.8 seconds and reach a max. speed of 140kmph. The team
              participated in Formula Green 2020 held at Kari Motor Speedway,
              Coimbatore in February 2020.

              Being the best team among electric cars in India, we showcased our
              ability again by building a fully electric car to run across the
              tracks of Formula Green 2017 in Coimbatore. Saber, due to its
              unbeatable designing as well as awesome technical support, was
              able to beat the fastest team in competition by a gap of 31 second
              in friendly run. Panel was so impressed by its unique aero cooling
              system, cost effectiveness as well as hard work and dedication of
              Team that they gave us an Honorary entry in the next Formula Green
              Competition.

              With the automotive industry shifting towards electric vehicles
              and increasing climate change concerns, we developed an
              all-electric vehicle - BOLT in 2015 and participated in FSAE
              Australasia, held in Melbourne (Australia). The long term aim of
              the team was to advance the technology of electric vehicles so
              that they may become cheaper and more efficient compared to
              gasoline-powered conventional cars. The car design was finalised
              after rigorous simulation and analysis of mechanical and
              electrical systems using software like Ansys, SolidWorks, ADAMS,
              MATLAB, Labsim and Multisim. After all this hardwork and patience,
              the team finally got its reward, being number one Indian team in
              the Formula Student electric rankings.

              Taking a step further from IC Engine car, the team developed a
              plug-in series hybrid electric powertrain based race car and
              successfully participated at the international level in the
              Formula Student UK held at the Silverstone F1 Racetrack, UK from
              5-7 July 2013. It was organized by the Institution of Mechanical
              Engineers (IMechE) in association with Jaguar Land Rover, Mercedes
              AMG, Shell etc. A total of 149 international teams from
              prestigious universities around the globe were registered in the
              event, and IIT Roorkee Motorsports was the only team with a hybrid
              electric vehicle in the competition.
